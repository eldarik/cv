## üë®‚Äçüíª Engineering Experience

**Backend Developer** @ [Petfolk](https://petfolk.com) _(July 2021 - Present)_

Petfolk is a veterinary  for pets and their parents which bringing world class pet care services.

**Tasks, responsibilities, achievements**:
- Developed back office and management system for pet care centers. It includes all user interaction logic: appointment booking, center visiting, pet examination, and treatment plans. Mirrored functional was available for vets and managers so they could fully cover the user's pet, user, vets and manager's needs.
- Discussed the architecture of GraphQL: authorization layer, input objects, validations, filter objects, etc. It helped us as a team to build a system on how to use GraphQL. My contribution to this was in input objects: we created a specific layer that encapsulated the logic of user input. It helped the frontend to have less messy code connected to input forms.
- Developed real-time editing for veterinary exam forms using GraphQL subscriptions and over WebSockets to provide vet assistants with a better experience with the management system.
- Developed an app to capture DB backups from heroku and upload them to AWS S3 Glacier. Heroku can keep only the last 50 DB backups, but we need all of them, so I developed a separate app that checked the backups list, downloaded them, and uploaded to S3 Glacier.
- Developed GraphQL API for web and iOS applications.

**Technologies used:** Ruby 3.0.4, Ruby on Rails. 6.1.*, GraphQL, Redis, PostgreSQL 14, Heroku, TypeScript, Apollo, React.
